# [Loopy Loops](http://programmingpraxis.com/2011/03/18/loopy-loops/)
## March 18, 2011

I don’t like this silly question. But it has appeared recently on Hacker News and Stack Overflow (C/C++ and Java, and probably other languages but I quit searching), and generated lots of comments on both, and it’s apparently a popular interview question, so we may as well do it here, too:

`Print the numbers from 1 to 1000 without using any loop or conditional statements. Don’t just write the printf() or cout statement 1000 times.`

Your task is to write the program in your favorite language. Have fun — think of as many solutions as you can, or the wackiest, or the fewest characters in the source file, or some other best-in-category. When you are finished, you are welcome to read or run a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.
